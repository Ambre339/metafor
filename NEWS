Changes in metafor version 0.5-4

   o corrected the trimfill() function
   o improvements to various print functions
   o added a regtest() function for various regression tests of
     funnel plot asymmetry (e.g., Egger's regression test)
   o made ranktest() generic and added a method for objects of 
     class "rma" so that the test can be carried out after fitting
   o added anova() function for full vs reduced model comparisons
     via fit statistics and likelihood ratio tests
   o added the Orwin and Rosenberg approaches to fsn()
   o added H^2 measure to the output for random-effects models
   o in escalc(), measure="COR" is now used for the (usual) raw
     correlation coefficient and measure="UCOR" for the bias
     corrected correlation coefficients
   o some small corrections to the documentation

Changes in metafor version 0.5-3

   o small changes to some of the examples
   o added the log transformed proportion (measure="PLN") as another 
     measure to the escalc() function; changed "PL" to "PLO" for the 
     logit (i.e., log odds) transformation for proportions

Changes in metafor version 0.5-2

   o added an option in plot.rma.uni.infl() to open a new device 
     for plotting the DFBETAS values
   o thanks to Jim Lemon, added a much better method of adjusting 
     the size of the labels, annotations, and symbols in the forest() 
     function when the number of studies is large

Changes in metafor version 0.5-1

   o made some small changes to the documentation (some typos 
     corrected, some confusing points clarified)

First version released on CRAN: 0.5-0
